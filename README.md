# Claude Configuration Repository

This repository contains my daily-use Claude agents, commands, and configurations that enhance AI-assisted software development workflows.

## Overview

This is a curated collection of specialized Claude agents and prompt configurations that I use regularly for various development tasks. The repository represents the current state of my work with Claude prompts, organized to be easily shareable and reusable.

## Repository Structure

### Agents (`/agents`)
Six specialized agents for different development tasks:
- **codebase-analyzer** - Analyzes implementation details and traces data flow
- **codebase-locator** - Locates files and components (super grep/glob/ls tool)
- **codebase-pattern-finder** - Finds similar implementations and patterns
- **thoughts-analyzer** - Deep research analysis on documentation
- **thoughts-locator** - Discovers relevant documents in thoughts/ directories
- **web-search-researcher** - Comprehensive web research for modern information

### Commands (`/commands`)
Structured workflow templates:
- **plan-implementation** - Creates comprehensive implementation plans
- **plan-tech-research** - Develops detailed technical specifications
- **prime** - Context priming for project understanding

### Configuration
- **CLAUDE.md** - Global user instructions overriding default Claude behavior
- **settings.json** - Tool permissions and safety configurations

## Usage

These configurations work with Claude to provide specialized assistance for:
- Codebase analysis and navigation
- Technical research and specification development
- Implementation planning and pattern recognition
- Structured development workflows

## Notes

Some agents are sourced from the HumanLayer project and have been adapted for personal use. The configurations are actively maintained and represent proven patterns from daily Claude interactions.
